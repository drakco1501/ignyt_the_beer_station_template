# ignyt_the_beer_station_template

As part of an online internship at Varcons, I developed a responsive and visually appealing template for a fictional beer station, Ignyt, using HTML and CSS. The project focuses on creating a sleek and modern design, showcasing an intuitive layout for a beverage-themed website.

Key Features:
Responsive Design: Ensures optimal viewing experience across devices.

Modern Aesthetics: A clean, visually engaging interface suitable for a beer station brand.
